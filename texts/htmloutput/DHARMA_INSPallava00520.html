         <h2>Commentary</h2>  
         <p>This inscription is part of a series of names found on a group of rocks. See also
            ttfaPallava52, tfaPallava514-519. Six names (tfaPallava52, 514-517, 520) are found
            on the rock locally known as <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>noṇṭi vīrappaṉ kutiraitoṭṭi</i></span> (“the watering place of the horse of Noṇṭi Vīrappaṉ”). One on a second rock nearby
            (tfaPallava518). One on a third rock in the same place (tfaPallava519).</p>  
         <p>SII 12: The following seven labels are engraved in archaic Tamil and Grantha characters
            on a group of rocks, one of which, on account of a natural cavity in it, is locally
            known as ’Noṇḍi Vīrappaṉ Kudiraitoṭṭi’. The names Kevadaperundachchaṉ and Kollaṉ Śēmagaṉ
            found in this place indicate that the persons bearing these names belonged to the
            artisan class. One of the labels also gives the name Guṇamallaḥ. On account of their
            palaeographical interest, these labels, as also the one given in the previous inscription
            (SII 12.23 = IP ***), are included here and some of them are reproduced on plate VI
            (plate II in fact).</p>  </div>
